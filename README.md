### ANDROID DEVELOPER TEST
***

The ask is simple:
+ ðŸ‘Š clone this clean repository into your workspace
+ ðŸ‘Š do what needs to be done
+ ðŸ‘Š create a pull request and send it back to us

---
---
**STACK:**
---
+ Kotlin
+ Kotlin Coroutines
+ Dagger - Hilt
+ Retrofit
+ Navigation Component
+ AndroidX Lifecycle
+ Moshi

**TODO:**
---
**Part 1:**

Please clone this repository and run the app

**Rember, follow MVVM architecture guidelines**

Create a character list using the RecyclerView
+ An endpoint with a list of characters is partially ready. You need to create a character serializable model based on the API documentation
+ The layout of a single item in a list must include at least the name, status and avatar. The nicer it looks the better (what's nice is a matter of taste, but using different font faces etc. shows you now how to find your way around Android layouts)
+ pagination or an endless scroll is not required but will be much appreciated

**Part 2:**

Create a separate screen with detailed information of the selected character
+ add the correct API endpoint and call it to get the data (don't just rely on data from the list view)
+ The layout must include at least avatar,
+ full name, gender, species, status, nicely formatted creation date and a clickable link to the character's URL.
+ Again the nicer it looks, the better but we don't expect you to spend half a day on it.
+ All we want to see is how well you can play with positioning elements of a layout

---
**Part 3 (OPTIONAL):**

This part is just as optional as are unit tests ðŸ˜‰.
You can skip it if you thinks tests are a waste of time...
Configure and add a few unit tests that will cover the view models

---
---
**API ROUTES:**

The app is using The Rick And Morty API
https://rickandmortyapi.com/

Please follow their official docs: 
https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/#rest

Good Luck and we sincerely hope to welcome you on board soon!!!
